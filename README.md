# Corona Game Engine

The [RazerSDK](https://github.com/razerofficial/razer-sdk-docs) can be accessed via the `RazerSDK Corona Plugin`.

## Examples 

* Since `Cocos2d` projects are so large in size, use the terminal to generate the `Cocos2d` project and then copy the modified example files over the generated project.

### In-App-Purchase Example

The [InAppPurchases](https://github.com/razerofficial/corona-plugin-razer-sdk/tree/master/InAppPurchases) sample is both a `Corona Simulator` and `Corona Enterpise` project.
